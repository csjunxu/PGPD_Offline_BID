The code in this package implements the Patch Group Prior Denoising (PGPD) method for
image denoising as described in the following paper:

Overview
------------
The code for learning Patch Group Prior is implemented in the folder "PG-GMM_Traning", which relies
on the training images in the subfolder "Kodak24".

The function "Demo_denoising" demonstrates denoising with the learned Patch Group Prior models 
introduced in the paper, which can all be found in the folder "model".

Dependency
------------
This code is implemented purely in Matlab2014b and doesn't depends on any other toolbox.
